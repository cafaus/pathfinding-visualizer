# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer!!. i bulit this application because i always wanted to see pathfinding algorithm in action. i hope you enjoy playing with my application. you can access it [here](https://cafaus.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/) using google chrome

## `Algorithms`

this application supports:

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

is an algorithm for finding the shorthest paths between nodes in a graph.

### A\* Algorithm

arguably the best pathfinding algorithm, uses heuristic to guarantee the shortest path and much faster than Djikstra's Algorithm
